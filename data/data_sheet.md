## Motivation

- The dataset was created for the purpose of providing historical stock prices for all companies currently found on the S&P 500 index, which can be used for analysis and prediction of market trends and performance.
- The dataset was created by Cam Nugent, a Kaggle user, on behalf of himself. The creation of the dataset was not funded by any external entity.

## Composition

- The instances that comprise the dataset represent daily stock prices for individual companies, labelled by their stock ticker name. Each instance has six attributes: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
- There are 619,040 instances in total, corresponding to 505 companies over five years (2013-2018).
- There is some missing data due to holidays or other reasons when the market was closed.
- The dataset does not contain data that might be considered confidential.

## Collection process

- The data was acquired from The Investor's Exchange API, using a simple script that can be found in this GitHub repository.
- The data is a comprehensive subset of the S&P 500 index, which includes all the companies that are currently or were previously part of the index during the time frame of the data collection.
- The data was collected over a time frame of five years, from February 2013 to February 2018.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- No preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data was done by the dataset creator. The data is presented as it was acquired from the API.
- The "raw" data is saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data, in the form of individual .csv files for each company and a merged .csv file for all companies.

## Uses

- The dataset could be used for other tasks such as:
  - Visualizing and comparing the stock prices and volumes of different companies over time
  - Calculating and graphing stock statistics such as volatility, moving averages, returns, etc.
  - Developing and testing predictive models for stock prices or market movements
  - Exploring the relationships and correlations between different stocks or sectors
  - Identifying patterns, trends, anomalies or outliers in the stock market
- There are some aspects of the dataset composition and collection process that might impact future uses, such as:
  - The dataset only covers a specific time period and does not include more recent or historical data
  - The dataset only includes companies that are part of the S&P 500 index and does not represent the entire stock market or other markets
  - The dataset may contain errors or inaccuracies due to limitations or changes in the API or the data source
  - The dataset may not reflect some events or factors that affect the stock market, such as dividends, splits, mergers, acquisitions, etc.
- A dataset consumer might need to know these aspects to avoid uses that could result in misleading or inaccurate conclusions or decisions based on the data. A dataset consumer could mitigate these risks or harms by:
  - Updating the dataset with more recent or historical data from other sources
  - Supplementing the dataset with data from other markets or indices
  - Validating and verifying the data quality and consistency
  - Accounting for external events or factors that affect the stock market
- There are no tasks for which the dataset should not be used, as long as the dataset consumer is aware of its limitations and caveats.

## Distribution

- The dataset has already been distributed on Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning competitions and projects.
- The dataset is subject to Kaggle's Terms of Use (ToU), which include a license grant to Kaggle and its users to access, use, copy, distribute and create derivative works from the dataset.

## Maintenance

- The dataset is maintained by Cam Nugent, who updates it periodically with new data and accounts for changes in the stocks on the S&P 500 index.
